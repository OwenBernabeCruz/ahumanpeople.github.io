                    <p>I am Carlos Ramirez. I am a 15 year old Mexican-American kid that likes to laugh. I enjoy hanging out with friends and try to be as kind as possible. During this summer I have been attending SMASH Berkeley but during the school year I attend Mission High School. In the near future I hope to attend UC Berkeley and become a mechanical engineer. My goal in life is to be able to provide for my family and eventually buying a house for my mom and dad.</p>

                    <p>Hello, I'm Hoang Nguyen. I'm a 16 year old at Oakland High School, and I attend SMASH Berkeley 2018-2021. A little about myself, I play as a Linemen and Linebacker for my high school's JV football team and I also run long distance for their Varsity Track and Field team. In the future, I'd like to major in Mechanical Engineering or Robotics Engineering because as a kid, I'm very fascinated in how things work and how it's made. For this project, I am a researcher along with Carlos Ramirez.</p>

I have a passion for programming and hope to pursue a career in computer science in the future. I strive to further improve myself for my siblings who look up to me and my mother who depends on my success. I hope to, in the future, open a business that manages websites from the styling to the servers to the data storage.</p>
